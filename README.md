Ledger Tracking Web App


A simple, local ledger app to track payments and expenses with FIFO allocation.

Overview
The Ledger Tracking Web App is a lightweight, PHP-based application designed to help you manage your bank account transactions locally. Built with PHP 8.1 and SQLite, it allows you to manually track payments (income) and expenses, automatically allocating expenses to the oldest available payments using a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) approach. All data is stored securely in a local SQLite database, ensuring privacy and simplicity.

Whether you're tracking business income, personal gifts, or miscellaneous deposits, this app provides a clean interface to monitor your finances with ease.
